# Project by Mahmoud Eybo (Hozan) and Ahmad Amer Bakran

## Introduction
This repository hosts the project developed by Mahmoud Eybo (Hozan) and Ahmad Amer Bakran as part of our 3rd-semester examination for the Datamatiker Study.

## Important Notice on UI Compatibility
We would like to bring to your attention an essential aspect regarding the user interface of this project. 

**Please ensure that you are using the dark mode setting when accessing the frontend of our application.** 
This recommendation stems from a late discovery in our development process, where we realized that the UI elements are optimally designed for dark mode compatibility. 
Due to time constraints, we were unable to modify the design for light mode compatibility. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
